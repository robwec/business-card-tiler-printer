Business cards are 1050x600 pixels = 3.5 x 2 inches. Can fit 12 of them to a sheet with slight shrink (print to fit page). They fit in an Altoids tin or a business card holder.

To run:
0. Make 1 or more business cards at 1050x600 pixel size.
1. Manually the business card(s) you want to print to 01.png to 12.png in the in/ folder. maketwelve-command.txt is there to help you set up a list and quickly copy them.
2. Run sh business-card-tiler-imagemagick.sh

Requires imagemagick. I'm running this on Linux.

Currently programmed to make a 2px black line between and around all cards, to make it easier to cut the cards out using a paper cutter or scissors.

When printing business cards, I highly recommend "laminating" them on both sides with packing tape to make them last practically forever. Or settle for a flimsy card printed on vinyl that nonetheless survives practically all damage and roughhousing.
